# ABOUT ME
###### I'm abdqudus. I am a frontend developer. I am building this blog as a practice for my all in Africa training.
###### I love CSS, javaScript and React and I hope to be a great web developer in the nearest future.
###### I plan to document my journey here, so I can keep track of my development, and also be able to look back from time to time to be thankful for growth and achievement.
